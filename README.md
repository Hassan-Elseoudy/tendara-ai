### Tendara AI take-home challenge

#### Intro
Welcome to Tendara's take-home challenge!

This is a small coding task designed to give you a sense of the kind of problems we solve at Tendara and to see how you approach them. 

It should take no more than 3 hours to complete, and itâ€™s intentionally open-ended.  
Feel free to use any AI tools you prefer, as we want this to resemble a real-world problem-solving environment that we work in every day. However, weâ€™ll also be evaluating the quality of your code. ðŸ˜‰

#### Installation
This is a small python poetry project, so installing it should be as simple as:
```
poetry install
```

### Problem: Matching Notices
You can find the description of the problem in [`Problem Statement.md`](Problem%20Statement.md).

#### Using Third-Party LLM Providers
Feel free to use the OpenAI API or any other LLM provider. Weâ€™ll provide you with a temporary API key to cover any costs.

### Submission
For submission, please send us a zip file containing your code.

Have fun!
